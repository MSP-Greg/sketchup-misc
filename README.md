# sketchup-misc

Miscellaneous code for use with SketchUp, and misc docs

The file `ruby_info/su_info.rb` outputs Ruby related information when loaded.

Other files exist that show various behaviors in SketchUp. Typically these show
issues realted to the SketchUP Ruby API, and so are related to plugins/extensions.

I may force push to the repo, so please account for that when updating forks or clones.

```
git pull <remote name> main --rebase
```
